0.4.1 (tag NN):
===============
	* cron script: redirect error output to /dev/null

        * core: cosmetical code improvements to make old gcc-2.95 more happy
        * core: fixed quite some problems when doing "make install" to an arbitrary
                prefix, thanks to Achim Bohnet for pointing me to these
        * core: moved "capisuite" to <prefix>/sbin instead of bin

	* scripts: fixed bug #527 in incoming.py that lead to idle.py doing
	           nothing after a while and so no faxes were sent any more
	* scripts: fixed remote inquiry: mixed new and old messages sometimes
	* scripts: stricter permissions of received files and dirs, thx to 
                   Achim Bohnet for reporting bug #544
	* scripts: dial_prefix implemented, closes bug #537, reported by Achim 	
	* scripts: better check for options read from config files, any missing
                   option either has a default now or produces an error message
		   -> fixes bug #531, thx to Dieter Pelzel(?) for reporting

0.4 (tag CAPISUITE_04):
=======================
	* added cron script for cleaning up spool dirs
	* fixed bug in rc.capisuite (was also started when not configured)
	* scripts: remote inquiry supports new and old messages now
	* scripts: capisuitefax can show sendqueue and delete jobs now

0.3.2 (tag CAPISUITE_032):
==========================
	* core: finally got rid of the CommonC++ library:
		- threading implemented using native pthread_* calls
		- rewritten CapiSuite::parseConfigFile() to use STL string routines
		- changed Connection class to use pthread_mutex_*
	* scripts: fixed bug which lead to hanging processes of externally started 
	           progs like sendmail
	* scripts: minor fixes 
		
0.3.1 (tag CAPISUITE_031):
==========================
	* dist: included spec and init file in CVS and dist
	* scripts: use different sendqueues for each user 
	* core: fixed some bugs: 
		- capisuite.error() didn't work, 
		- logging in outgoing connections didn't work 
		- callingParty wasn't set correctly
	* scripts: answering machine switches to fax when incoming service indicator says fax
	* scripts: sayNumber can now handle all number from 0 to 99, so all dates and times are 
	  now said nearly correctly for the remote inquiry
	* scripts: fixed a typo in incoming.py
	* docs: added ISDN/CAPI error codes to manual 

0.3 (tag CAPISUITE_03):
=======================
	* split up script configuration in two files (anwering machine, fax),
	  some new features configurable now (e.g. actions)

0.2.1 (tag CAPISUITE_021):
==========================
	* many document improvements (new DocBook manual)

0.2 (tag CAPISUITE_02):
=======================
	* log improvements: log-level configurable (see capisuite.conf), appending log-file instead of re-creating
	* configure allows to set docdir with --with-docdir 
	* CapiSuite can be finished using Ctrl-C and SIGTERM nicely 
	* very limited support for reload (kill -1) - only re-activates de-actived idle script yet,
	  no reload of configuration
	* all configuration for the scripts put in own config file 
	* support for various new configuration options, multi-user-ready scripts (different user dirs in spool_dir/users)
	* audio_receive does truncate recorded silence away 
	* remote inquiry supports recording of own announcement
	* commandline option "-d" runs CapiSuite as daemon
	* new python commands: capisuite.log and capisuite.error let scripts write messages to the CapiSuite log
	  and error log
	 
0.1 (tag CAPISUITE_01):
=======================
	* "make install" and "make dist" work now, use config.h
	* added main docu page for doxygen
	* added capisuitefax-script (command line tool for sending faxes)
	* added support for sending faxes in idle.py
	* added support for "capisuite.conf" (global configuration file)
	* capisuite can write its output to logfiles now
	* faxsend module added, new python function fax_send()
	* idle script will be disabled after 10 subsequent errors
	* B3 disconnect cause now returned by disconnect() python function

0.03 (tag CAPISUITE_003):
=========================

	* improvement in idle script handling, own class for it (IdleScript)
	* new classes for Python script handling (PythonScript) and derived classes 
	  (IncomingScript & IdleScript)
	* new python functions call_voice and call_faxG3 to initiate outgoing calls
	* changed python exception handling to allow multiple calls in one script to be 
 	  handled correctly
	* python functions disconnect() and reject() wait for complete disconnection and  
	  return the disconnect cause now
	* assure nice disconnection in any error case (hopefully)
	* when error occured in script, physical connection is finished immediately leading 
	  to an error visible at the sending side (e.g. when using the fax protocol)
	* cleaned up python reference counting and threads, no known memory leaks any more 
	* many changes to support outgoing calls (new module, many small changes) 
	* Connection objects will be destroyed by application level now so dangling pointers
	  are avoided
	* exception handling generally improved

0.02 (tag CAPISUITE_002):
=========================

	* many bug fixes as usual (SEGV, ...)
	* service constants SERVICE_VOICE, SERVICE_FAXG3 and SERVICE_OTHER

	* audio_send and audio_receive return length in seconds now
	* added support for idle script which can initiate outgoing calls

0.01 (tag CAPISUITE_001):
=========================

	* changed name from CapiCom to CapiSuite (name conflict with MS crypto API)
	* added doxygen-created documentation for classes and python exported functions
	* get_DTMF() was renamed to read_DTMF() and can wait for DTMF now
	* connect_telephony() renamed to connect_voice()
