.SH NAME
capisuite.conf \- configuration of the CapiSuite daemon
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
The options for the CapiSuite daemon are configured here\&. They will be presented in brief here \- for further details please refer to the comments in the configuration file itself\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\fBincoming_script="/path/to/incoming\&.py"\fR
This option tells CapiSuite which script should be executed at incoming calls\&. Only change this if you want to use your own script\&.

.TP
\fBidle_script="/path/to/idle\&.py"\fR
This option reflects the path and name of the idle script\&. This script is called in regular intervalls to check if any outgoing call should be done\&. As above, the default should be ok if you don't use your own script\&.

.TP
\fBidle_script_interval="30"\fR
Here you can define how often the idle script should be executed\&. The number given is the interval between subsequent invocations in seconds\&. Lesser numbers give you quicker response to queued jobs but also a higher system load\&. The default should be ok in most cases\&.

.TP
\fBlog_file="/path/to/capisuite\&.log"\fR
This file will be used for all "normal" messages printed byCapiSuite telling you what it does\&. Error messages are written to a special log (see below)\&.

.TP
\fBlog_level="1"\fR
You can define how detailled the log output of CapiSuite will be\&. The default will give you some informational messages for each incoming and outgoing call and should be enough for normal use\&. I would recommend to only increase it if you encounter some problems\&. Logs of higher level are mainly intended for developers, so just use them if you want to report a problem or have some know\-how of the CAPI interface and the internals of CapiSuite\&.

.TP
\fBlog_error="/path/to/capisuite\&.error"\fR
All errors which CapiSuite detects internally and in your scripts will end up here\&. They are written to an extra file so that they don't get lost in the normal log\&. Please check this log regularly for any messages \- especially when you encounter problems\&. Please report all messages you don't understand and which aren't caused by your own script\-modifications to the CapiSuite team\&.
