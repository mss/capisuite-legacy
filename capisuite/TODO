CRITICAL:
- finish manual.docbook, provide simple examples
- somewhere there's a bad thing (tm) which holds the python global lock
  despite it mustn't (try incoming + outgoing call at the same time,
  idlescript will stop working sometime...)

IMPORTANT:
- fax headline

NICE:
- ?valgrind-clean the used libs and Python?
- support more than one send_controller
- don't use 34xx codes, define constants instead and print meaningful messages
- include email account check in idly.py 
- add docbook -> html to Makefile.am
- any solution for sending fax when having no fax config?

FUTURE PLANS:
- setuid away from root (problem: chown of recorded file to user)
- log syntax errors in scripts, too
	- PyRun_SimpleFile must be replaced by PyRun_File for this IMHO
- test-implement the whole application part in Python
- rewrite capisuitefax and idle.py to use named socket communication
