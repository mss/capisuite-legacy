	* configure.in: test for the sfftobmp version installed
	* acinclude.m4 (CS_TEST_SFFTOBMP): Likewise.
	* scripts/cs_helpers.pyin (sfftotiff,sendMIMEMail): New function which
	  calls sfftobmp so that the parameters can be easily changed. Include
	  two versions for sfftomp 2.x and 3.x. Thanks for reporting this
	  issue goes to Edelhard Becker.
	* scripts/Makefile.am (.pyin.py): Choose the right sfftobmp call
	  automatically during build.
	* acinclude.m4 (CS_SET_DOCDIR,CS_TEST_GCC3): fix underquoted macros
	* scripts/cs_helpers.pyin (sendMIMEMail,sendSimpleMail): use smtplib
	  instead of manual call to sendmail as many reports showed that 
	  calling sendmail doesn't work reliable on some systems
