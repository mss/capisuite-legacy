TODO (high to low IMHO)

o split manpages out of manual.sgml
o logrotate log files (to examples?)
o fix perms of capi log/error file
o remove log files on purge (policy)

o split manual/reference into capisuite-doc pkg

o Try to build on Debian unstable
o try chroot builds for stable/unstable. pbuild or sbuild?
o limit arch to i386 just as libcapi20 does
__END__
