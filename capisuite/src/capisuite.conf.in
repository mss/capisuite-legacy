#
# This is the global configuration file for CapiSuite
#
# Some general options will be set here, which define which scripts
# to use, when to start them and what to log and where.
#
# All other options are defined in the python scripts given here
# or (preferably) are read from them from some other configuration
# files.
#
# As usual, lines starting with # or empty lines will be ignored 
#
# The rest must be key value pairs written as key=value.
#
# Additional whitespaces and quotation marks (") surrounding
# the values will be ignored.

# incoming_script
#
# This python script will be called when an incoming call occurs.
#
# It must define a python function named "callIncoming".
#
incoming_script="@pkglibdir@/incoming.py"

# idle_script
#
# This python script will be called in regular intervals giving
# you the ability to search for needed actions (like send fax)
# in a queue (or somewhere else) and initiate the calls.
#
# It must define a python function named "idle". It's allowed
# to use the same script for incoming_script and idle_script
#
idle_script="@pkglibdir@/idle.py"

# idle_script_interval
#
# The given idle_script will be called in regular intervals.
#
# The length of the intervals in seconds is given here. If you
# don't want to use an idle script, set it to "0"
#
idle_script_interval="30"

# log_file
#
# The file given here is used for writing normal log messages to.
#
log_file="@localstatedir@/log/capisuite.log"

# log_level
#
# Selects how chatty CapiSuite will be:
#
# 0 = only very few messages (e.g. system start/stop)
# 1 = some important messages (e.g. connection start/end)
# 2 = many debug messages (nearly every CAPI message logged)
# 3 = all debug messages (all CAPI messages - include every transmitted data package, every script execution)
log_level="1"

# log_error
#
# The file given here is used for writing error messages to.
#
# Error messages are separated so you can easily find them.
#
log_error="@localstatedir@/log/capisuite.error"
