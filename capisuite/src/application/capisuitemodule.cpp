/** @defgroup python C/Python wrapper functions
    @brief These functions define the python commands you can use in your scripts.

    All CapiSuite-commands available in Python will stay in a python
    module called capisuite. This module and all its functions are defined here.

    There's a general scheme for mapping the names of the C wrapper functions
    to python names:

    Python command "capisuite.command()" will be defined in the wrapper function
    "capisuite_command()".

    So you can use this document as reference to all available CapiSuite Python
    commands. For example, if you read the documentation for the
    capisuite_audio_send function here, you can use it as capisuite.audio_send in
    your Python scripts.

/** @brief Read the received DTMF tones or wait for a certain amount of them.
    @ingroup python

    This function allows to just read in the DTMF tones which were already received. But it also supports to
    wait for a certain amount of DTMF tones if you want the user to always input some digits at a certain
    step in your script.

    You can specify how much DTMF tones you want in several ways - see the parameter description. To just
    see if something was entered before, use capisuite.read_DTMF(0). If you want to get at least 1 and mostly 4 digits
    and want to wait 5 seconds for additional digits, you'll use capisuite.read_DTMF(5,1,4).

    Valid DTMF characters are '0'...'9','A'...'D' and two special fax tones: 'X' (CNG), 'Y' (CED)

    @param args Contains the python parameters. These are:
    	- <b>call</b> Reference to the current call
    	- <b>timeout (integer)</b> timeout in seconds after which reading is terminated, only applied when min_digits are reached! (-1 = infinite)
	- <b>min_digits (integer, optional)</b> minimum number of digits which must be read in ANY case, i.e. timout doesn't count here (default: 0)
  	- <b>max_digits (integer, optional)</b> maximum number of digits to read (aborts immediately if this number is reached) (0=infinite, i.e. only timeout counts, default)

- missed some changes from CapiCom to CapiSuite

Revision 1.1  2002/11/29 11:06:22  ghillie
renamed CapiCom to CapiSuite (name conflict with MS crypto API :-( )

Revision 1.5  2002/11/29 10:20:44  ghillie
- updated docs, use doxygen format now

Revision 1.4  2002/11/27 15:56:56  ghillie
renamed connect_telephony to connect_voice

Revision 1.3  2002/11/25 11:48:48  ghillie
- improved parameter descriptions for python functions
- made more python parameter optional
- removed CIPvalue from application layer, use service type instead
- renamed get_DTMF() to read_DTMF(), added additional parameters (timeout, min_/max_digits), uses ReadDTMF-module now

Revision 1.2  2002/11/23 15:55:51  ghillie
changed some misleading function names

Revision 1.1  2002/11/22 15:44:54  ghillie
renamed pcallcontrol.* to capicommodule.*

Revision 1.18  2002/11/22 15:07:09  ghillie
- new python function switch_to_faxG3
- new parameter exit_DTMF for audio_send() and audio_receive()
- new parameters faxStationID and faxHeadline for connect_faxG3
- get_DTMF calls conn->clearDTMF() now

Revision 1.17  2002/11/21 15:26:19  ghillie
- removed some unnecessary commands (we don't need result of mainLoop() any more, no need to use pointers for call modules any more)
- removed python command connect(call,CIP), added connect_telephony() and connect_faxG3()
- connect_telephony() and connect_faxG3 take delay in seconds before connect as parameter now
- unified python function names (enableDTMF -> enable_DTMF, disableDTMF -> disable_DTMF, getDTMF -> get_DTMF

Revision 1.16  2002/11/20 17:23:04  ghillie
- fixed locking in the case of an exception. Python locks weren't set-up again when an exception occurred
- removed unnecessary conn->isUp() calls (handled via exceptions now)
- CapiWrongState exception causes CallGoneError to be issued in Python now
- removed unnecessary PyErr_Occured() calls at the end of each function
- added missing Py_XDECREF in _init()

Revision 1.15  2002/11/19 15:57:18  ghillie
- Added missing throw() declarations
- phew. Added error handling. All exceptions are caught now.

Revision 1.14  2002/11/18 14:21:07  ghillie
- moved global severity_t to ApplicationError::severity_t
- added throw() declarations to header files

Revision 1.13  2002/11/18 12:08:46  ghillie
return reference to GetDict(__main__) instead of GetDict(pcallcontrol), so that callIncoming can live in __main__

Revision 1.12  2002/11/17 14:36:32  ghillie
improved error handling: script will now terminate if B3 connection is lost
(each function checks for PyErr_Occurred() and conn->isUp() now)

Revision 1.11  2002/11/14 17:04:05  ghillie
* major structural changes - much is easier, nicer and better prepared for the future now:
  - added DisconnectLogical handler to CallInterface
  - DTMF handling moved from CallControl to Connection
  - new call module ConnectModule for establishing connection
  - python script reduced from 2 functions to one (callWaiting, callConnected
    merged to callIncoming)
  - call modules implement the CallInterface now, not CallControl any more
    => this freed CallControl from nearly all communication stuff

* converter function for PyCObject -> Connection pointer introduced
  -> this saves us many identical code lines in all Python/C integration
     functions

Revision 1.10  2002/11/13 15:23:21  ghillie
added new parameter to audio_receive (silence_timeout)
fixed deadlock: in deletion of call modules must happen w/o holding python global lock

Revision 1.9  2002/11/13 08:34:54  ghillie
moved history to the bottom

Revision 1.8  2002/11/10 17:03:45  ghillie
now CallControl reference is passed directly to the called Pyhton functions

Revision 1.7  2002/11/06 16:16:07  ghillie
added code to raise CallGoneError in any case so the script is cancelled when the call is gone surely

Revision 1.6  2002/10/31 12:35:58  ghillie
added DTMF support

Revision 1.5  2002/10/30 16:05:20  ghillie
cosmetic fixes...

Revision 1.4  2002/10/30 14:25:54  ghillie
added connect,disconnect,reject functions, changed init function to return the module dictionary

Revision 1.3  2002/10/29 14:07:38  ghillie
changed to implecete pass call parameter so the user doesn't have to type it in the script...

Revision 1.2  2002/10/27 12:47:20  ghillie
- added multithread support for python
- changed callcontrol reference to stay in the python namespace
- changed ApplicationError to support differen severity

Revision 1.1  2002/10/25 13:29:38  ghillie
grouped files into subdirectories

Revision 1.3  2002/10/24 09:55:52  ghillie
many fixes. Works for one call now

Revision 1.2  2002/10/23 15:42:11  ghillie
- added standard headers
- changed initialization code (object references now set in extra function)
- added some missing Py_None
