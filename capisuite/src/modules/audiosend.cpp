$Log: audiosend.cpp,v $
Revision 1.1  2003/02/19 08:19:53  gernot
Initial revision

Revision 1.14  2003/01/19 16:50:27  ghillie
- removed severity in exceptions. No FATAL-automatic-exit any more.
  Removed many FATAL conditions, other ones are exiting now by themselves

Revision 1.13  2002/12/04 11:38:50  ghillie
- added time measurement: save time in start_time at the begin of mainLoop() and return difference to getTime() in duration()

Revision 1.12  2002/12/02 12:32:21  ghillie
renamed Connection::SPEECH to Connection::VOICE

Revision 1.11  2002/11/29 10:27:44  ghillie
- updated comments, use doxygen format now

Revision 1.10  2002/11/25 11:54:35  ghillie
- tests for speech mode before receiving now
- small performance improvement (use string::empty() instead of comparison to "")

Revision 1.9  2002/11/22 15:16:20  ghillie
added support for finishing when DTMF is received

Revision 1.8  2002/11/21 15:32:40  ghillie
- moved code from constructor/destructor to overwritten mainLoop() method

Revision 1.7  2002/11/21 11:37:09  ghillie
make sure that we don't use Connection object after call was finished

Revision 1.6  2002/11/19 15:57:19  ghillie
- Added missing throw() declarations
- phew. Added error handling. All exceptions are caught now.

Revision 1.5  2002/11/14 17:05:19  ghillie
major structural changes - much is easier, nicer and better prepared for the future now:
- added DisconnectLogical handler to CallInterface
- DTMF handling moved from CallControl to Connection
- new call module ConnectModule for establishing connection
- python script reduced from 2 functions to one (callWaiting, callConnected
  merged to callIncoming)
- call modules implement the CallInterface now, not CallControl any more
  => this freed CallControl from nearly all communication stuff

Revision 1.4  2002/11/13 15:26:28  ghillie
removed unnecessary member attribute filename

Revision 1.3  2002/11/13 08:34:54  ghillie
moved history to the bottom

Revision 1.2  2002/10/29 14:28:22  ghillie
added stop_file_* calls to make sure transmission is cancelled when it's time...

Revision 1.1  2002/10/25 13:29:39  ghillie
grouped files into subdirectories

Revision 1.8  2002/10/23 15:37:50  ghillie
typo...

Revision 1.7  2002/10/23 14:10:27  ghillie
callmodules must register itself at connection class now

Revision 1.6  2002/10/09 14:36:22  gernot
added CallModule base class for all call handling modules

Revision 1.5  2002/10/05 20:43:32  gernot
quick'n'dirty, but WORKS

Revision 1.4  2002/10/05 13:53:00  gernot
changed to use thread class of CommonC++ instead of the threads-package
some cosmetic improvements (indentation...)

Revision 1.3  2002/10/04 15:48:03  gernot
structure changes completed & compiles now!

Revision 1.2  2002/10/04 13:27:15  gernot
some restructuring to get it to a working state ;-)

does not do anything useful yet nor does it even compile...

Revision 1.1  2002/09/22 14:55:21  gernot
adding audio send module
